Linux firmware tool for the Cypress EZ-OTG / EZ-Host / ScanLogic SL11R.
The EZ-* chip is found, among other places, on the Xilinx ML501.
ScanLogic SL11R-IDE is an old USB-to-IDE adapter.

This little tool replaces 'QTUI2C.EXE', which the supposedly Linux-friendly Cypress SDK shipped with.


To Build:

Simply enter 'make'. There is only one dependency: libusb 0.1 (development package is requred, e.g. libusb-dev in Debian).


Usage:

To burn 'firmware.bin' into your CY7C67300:

	./ezotgdbg -w firmware.bin

To upgrade SL11R-IDE firmware, use:

	./ezotgdbg -m cide26c.bin


If you have something other than a CY7C67300 that you believe is compatible (say, a 67200) - add your USB and Product IDs to device_table[] in ezotgdbg.c.
