Linux firmware tool for the Cypress EZ-OTG / EZ-Host.
The chip found, among other places, on the Xilinx ML501.

This little tool replaces 'QTUI2C.EXE', which the supposedly Linux-friendly Cypress SDK shipped with.


To Build:

Simply enter 'make'. There is only one dependency: libusb 1.0.


Usage:

To burn 'firmware.bin' into your CY7C67300:

	./ezotgdbg -w firmware.bin

That's it.


If you have something other than a CY7C67300 that you believe is compatible (say, a 67200) - change the USB and Product IDs in ezotgdbg.c to match yours.
