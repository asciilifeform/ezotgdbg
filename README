Linux firmware tool for the Cypress EZ-OTG / EZ-Host.
The chip found, among other places, on the Xilinx ML501.

This little tool replaces 'QTUI2C.EXE', which the supposedly Linux-friendly Cypress SDK shipped with.

Usage:

To burn 'firmware.bin' into your CY7C67300:

	./ezotgdbg -w firmware.bin

That's it.
